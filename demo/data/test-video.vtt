<v 0>Hi, this is just a short loom to say that I'm,</v>

2
00:00:02.965 --> 00:00:06.676
uhm, I'm intending refreshing my blog,

3
00:00:06.676 --> 00:00:09.332
uhm, by using,

4
00:00:09.332 --> 00:00:11.955
uhm, short loom videos,

5
00:00:11.955 --> 00:00:15.134
uhm, such as this, where I explain,

6
00:00:15.134 --> 00:00:19.314
uhm, something, uhm,

7
00:00:19.324 --> 00:00:21.798
so, some aspect of some work that I'm doing,

8
00:00:21.798 --> 00:00:24.581
uhm, and then I,

9
00:00:24.581 --> 00:00:28.271
uh, and then obviously upload the video.

10
00:00:28.271 --> 00:00:30.461
and embed it, uhm, on my blog,

11
00:00:30.483 --> 00:00:35.503
hopefully with some, uhm, hopefully with some captions

12
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.768
and some links to find out more.

13
00:00:37.768 --> 00:00:40.396
Uhm, yeah, I hope that's interesting.

14
00:00:40.396 --> 00:00:45.120
You can see, if you want to follow

15
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.546
progress, you can look, uhm,

16
00:00:47.556 --> 00:00:49.701
in the commit log, on my blog,

17
00:00:50.381 --> 00:00:52.461
and you can see how I'm using things like this,

18
00:00:52.461 --> 00:00:55.623
uhm, this custom element,

19
00:00:55.623 --> 00:00:59.642

20
00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:01.842
part of the embedding process.
