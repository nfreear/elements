00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.541
<v 0>Hi, so I wanted to talk to you today about</v>

2
00:00:04,542 --> 00:00:09,139
the, about modal dialogs and about

3
00:00:09,517 --> 00:00:14,352
the dialog position package that was recently published

4
00:00:14,655 --> 00:00:19,082
on the NPM website. Registry, and you can see it there.

5
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,705
Uhm, so we often,

6
00:00:21,706 --> 00:00:24,520
uhm, as accessibility consultants,

7
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:27,691
we often come across problems with,

8
00:00:27,692 --> 00:00:32,216
with keyboard, uhm, accessibility in relation

9
00:00:32,217 --> 00:00:35,756
to, in relation to modal dialogues, uhm,

10
00:00:35,767 --> 00:00:40,597
either things like the focus not being moved into a modal dialog,

11
00:00:40,598 --> 00:00:42,813
uhm, when it's,

12
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:48,093
when it's opened, or that focus is not restricted to

13
00:00:48,094 --> 00:00:51,260
the modal dialog. or indeed when we close the dialog,

14
00:00:51,261 --> 00:00:55,818
uhm, focus is not returned to the triggering

15
00:00:55,819 --> 00:00:59,384
element. Uhm, and so,

16
00:00:59,385 --> 00:01:02,231
uh, in the past,

17
00:01:02,232 --> 00:01:05,173
or, you know, in the recent past,

18
00:01:05,705 --> 00:01:11,605
we would have had to rely on quite a lot of ARIA and quite

19
00:01:11,606 --> 00:01:15,117
a lot of Javascript, uhm,

20
00:01:15,128 --> 00:01:19,585
to Good. So here's the APG,

21
00:01:19,586 --> 00:01:24,267
uhm, version that uses 330 lines

22
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:27,275
to implement a modal dialog,

23
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:30,603
and 330 lines of JavaScript,

24
00:01:30,604 --> 00:01:32,805
uhm, and so,

25
00:01:32,806 --> 00:01:38,602
obviously, it's quite a challenge, and it's quite a challenge to

26
00:01:38,603 --> 00:01:39,988
try to get things right, and it's quite a challenge to make things, to

27
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:42,602
make the modal dialog accessible,

28
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:45,774
uhm, but fortunately, it's certainly now,

29
00:01:45,775 --> 00:01:47,870
we have the native,

30
00:01:48,296 --> 00:01:51,069
eh, eh, eh, native element,

31
00:01:51,164 --> 00:01:55,772
HTML, HTML, native, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh,

32
00:01:55,773 --> 00:02:00,559
eh, native element. And that, erm, does a lot of the

33
00:02:00,663 --> 00:02:03,180
heavy lifting for us,

34
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:08,000
so it's, it's very, it's very good at managing

35
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:13,036
the focus of the keyboard.

36
00:02:13,037 --> 00:02:16,765
In the way that we want,

37
00:02:17,475 --> 00:02:20,646
and indeed, it is now widely supported.

38
00:02:20,951 --> 00:02:23,323
So it's supported, erm, it says on,

39
00:02:23,628 --> 00:02:25,834
on this website, on this website. And I use,

40
00:02:26,224 --> 00:02:29,544
it's supported by around, erm, I have 6% of,

41
00:02:29,545 --> 00:02:32,369
erm, I have 6% of browsers globally.

42
00:02:33,078 --> 00:02:37,649
Which is pretty good. Erm, the one

43
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,876
thing that the term people might be asking now is how,

44
00:02:40,957 --> 00:02:43,294
how to, Why you position, erm,

45
00:02:43,295 --> 00:02:45,336
how I push the native dialog,

46
00:02:45,529 --> 00:02:49,555
erm, on the page. Erm, it is,

47
00:02:49,556 --> 00:02:52,620
erm, it uses the CSS fixed,

48
00:02:53,027 --> 00:02:55,170
erm, fixed.

49
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:58,892
Fixed, eh, Position.

50
00:02:58,893 --> 00:03:01,233
Er, and so, erm, I went to this research, erm,

51
00:03:01,234 --> 00:03:04,198
and came up with quite a,

52
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:09,864
Erm, simple, erm, CSS style sheet.

53
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:14,448
Here we are, it's only 50 yards long.

54
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:18,778
Erm, and that allows you to position,

55
00:03:18,779 --> 00:03:21,450
based on a data attribute.

56
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,739
Erm, so a data-position attribute.

57
00:03:27,857 --> 00:03:31,776
Erm, these are the sporty values that you expect,

58
00:03:31,777 --> 00:03:34,858
so top, bottom, left, right. And those results,

59
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:40,626
in full height and full with modal modals.

60
00:03:41,744 --> 00:03:43,839
And then you can also use things like top,

61
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,340
hyphen, left, top, hyphen, right.

62
00:03:46,341 --> 00:03:48,615
Bottom, hyphen, left, bottom,

63
00:03:48,616 --> 00:03:50,998
hyphen, right. As well.

64
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:54,117
So, there you go.

65
00:03:54,118 --> 00:03:56,426
Umm, this is,

66
00:03:56,627 --> 00:04:00,062
erm, and here's a basic sort of demo that I put together,

67
00:04:00,063 --> 00:04:03,058
er, that uses this style sheet.

68
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:06,686
As you can see, as you move,

69
00:04:06,722 --> 00:04:12,123
as you click on the buttons, and

70
00:04:13,075 --> 00:04:18,047
it moves the modal dialog around the screen by

71
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:29,080
setting this data out to you. So,

72
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:33,648
really, that's, hopefully, that's really

73
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:34,928
handy, and would be a really useful tool for people going websites, and want

74
00:04:34,929 --> 00:04:36,766
to, make sure they're accessible.
